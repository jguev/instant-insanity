## This repo explores a solution to the [Instant Insanity](https://americanhistory.si.edu/collections/search/object/nmah_1425316) puzzle implemented with right triangular prisms and consisting of a puzzle-coloring scheme determined by a list of 93 colors. :eyes:

### :triangular_ruler: Specifications
1. Total of 31 slices, 3 faces on each slice
2. Slices are constrained to rotation - no flipping
3. The colors will be assigned counterclockwise
4. Each color must show up exactly 3 times before searching for obstacles

### :golf: Goal
Arrange the slices in a tower so that we achieve the minimum number of obstacles.
